ðŸ’¹ Sentiment Classification of Financial Data Using Random Forest
ðŸ“š Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying financial data based on sentiment using supervised machine learning models. The aim is to predict whether a financial position (trade) is profitable or not profitable using a variety of engineered features, with a particular emphasis on sentiment classification.

The primary models tested include:

Logistic Regression

âœ… Random Forest Classifier (Best Performing Model)

ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Boxplots were used to visualize Closed PnL distribution across sentiment classes.

A Kruskal-Wallis H test was conducted to assess statistical differences in PnL across sentiment groups.

The dataset showed imbalanced classes, which was addressed using class_weight='balanced'.

ðŸ§  Model Training
Logistic Regression
Baseline performance

Struggled with non-linearity and class imbalance

âœ… Random Forest Classifier
Handled imbalance effectively

Captured complex relationships in data

Provided feature importance scores

ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics
âœ… Random Forest Classifier â€“ Performance Report
âœ… Accuracy: 100%

ðŸš€ Conclusion: The model performs perfectly on the current dataset â€” suggesting either an extremely well-separated dataset or a need to validate against unseen or external data to avoid overfitting.

Key Insights
Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression due to:

Robust handling of non-linear patterns

Class-weight balancing to address skewed data

Ability to evaluate feature importance
